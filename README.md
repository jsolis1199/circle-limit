# Circle Limit

A polished revision of a script I wrote in the summer of 2015 for a research
project on the Circle Limits of M. C. Escher. `escher.wls p q` generates a
regular tessellation of the hyperbolic plane when $`p, q`$ satisfy
$`(p - 2)(q - 2) > 4`$.

## Prerequisites

The code is compatible with Mathematica 10 or higher and requires an
installation of WolframScript to be run on the command line.
